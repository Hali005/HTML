            <h3>Robust Attendance System Based on Smart face Identification</h3>
            <p>The main objective of designing this system is to mark the attendance automatically and accurately.
                Design of this algorithm is divided in to several phases. Firstly, a camera installed in the class is
                used
                to gather different video feeds. In the next phase detection algorithms are implemented for the
                detection of individual faces in the image. In the next part the low-quality images are passed through
                an algorithm for the enhancement of quality. Next, recognition algorithms are used for recognition
                purposes and to mark the attendance. If in any case algorithm fails to recognize a face, ranking
                approach is used to compute the distance and rank the faces for recognition. Lastly a complete
                graphical user interface is also designed to manage the profiles and logs of attendance. The video
                feeds are taken multiple times i.e., at the start of the class and then at the end of class to ensure
                that
                the student has attended the whole class. The results obtained are quite satisfactory and there is no
                as such ambiguity as was anticipated before the start of this project</p>
            <h3>Filtering Of Audio Signal Using DSPKIT DSK 6713</h3>
            <p>The aim of this project was to design a low pass filter capable of discarding frequencies higher
                then a given threshold value. The filter was designed using a tool in Matlab known as the FDA
                tool or Filter designer in newer versions and successfully implemented on the DSK6713 kit.</p>
            <h3 id="project">Stepper Motor Control Using STM32</h3>
            <p>The idea of the project was to design a complete working stepper motor control using STM32 and a
                keypad with FreeRTOS involves leveraging the STM32 microcontroller’s capabilities to drive and
                control a stepper motor’s motion, while also implementing a keypad interface to adjust the duty cycle
                of the motor movement. FreeRTOS is used to manage the concurrent execution of tasks and ensure
                rea time responsiveness</p>
